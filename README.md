# Richard Geoghegan

A former retailer turned coder, interested in making tasks simpler and easier through the medium of code.

Having been involved from the client side of web development in my previous job, this stirred a passion for how customer experiences can be vastly improved using code as well as business efficiency.

I am looking to continue my journey into the world of web development in an environment that supports junior developers with developing my newly found skills, working in a fun environment with like minded people.

### Skills
---

Below you will find my final project along with a small app completed in a makerthon, as well as a couple of my other projects completed whilst at Makers Academy.

|  Projects | A little about these... |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| [rand(Cast)](https://github.com/ShuflCast/randCast.git) | For our final project we built a podcast app that randomised the results of podcasts the user could listen too based on genre and duration they have selected. We built the app using Ionic framework |
| [OnTap](https://github.com/richgeog/onTap_2.git) | During a 2 day makerthon at Makers Academy, we made a beer finding application in Angular utilising the Yelp Api and Google maps to highlight the nearest pubs to the users location |
| [Instagram](https://github.com/richgeog/instagram-challenge.git) | A take on the popular photo sharing app Instagram, allowing users to upload thier images as well as comment and like other users photos. I used ruby on rails with ActiveRecord whilst utilising an MVC approach |
| [Chitter](https://github.com/richgeog/chitter-challenge.git) | Chitter, the younger brother to the very popular app Twitter. Chitter allows users to send peeps to one another and view all peeps in a simple chronological order. I used Sinatra, Ruby and data-mapper for this project |

#### Team Work and Communication

- In my previous role I would collaborate with multiple teams across many areas of the business, including clients and suppliers on a daily basis
- During my time at Makers, I have worked both in pairs and in larger groups for our projects, this included the running of our own stand ups
- Mentoring a fellow Makers student due to start in the next cohort allowed me to share my experiences and support them through their first few weeks of the course

#### Problem Solving

- This has always been something that has excited me, my previous roles allowed me to explore new simpler and cheaper ways for the business to improve the way tasks were completed, whilst having the customer at the fore front of all of my decisions
- Developing this skill during my time at Makers, along with a 'no quit' attitude has helped to realise the answer is always out there, just keep digging until you find it
