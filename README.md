## Richard Geoghegan

A former retailer turned coder, interested in making tasks simpler and easier through the medium of code. 

Having been involved from the client side of web development in my previous job, this stirred a passion for how customer experiences can be vastly improved using code.

I am looking to continue my journey into the world of web development in an environment that supports newbies(like me) with developing my newly found skills, whilst introducing me to new fun tech.
